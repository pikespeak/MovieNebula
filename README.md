# MovieNebula
MovieNebula is an experimental data-visualization project that explores the cinematic universe as a dynamic network. It transforms movie metadata (e.g. genres, people, years, similarities) into an interactive, planet-like graph, allowing users to discover hidden connections between films through visual exploration.
